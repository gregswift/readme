# Quick Background

# First Questions

One of the first books I read becoming a manager was Resilient Management by Lara Hogan.  In that book she has an excellent set of starter questions that I ask all my reports early in our 1:1s.  Here are my answers. From: https://larahogan.me/blog/first-one-on-one-questions/

## Grumpiness

### What makes you grumpy?

### How will I know when you’re grumpy?

Typically, I get shorter and more "just the matter at hand".  I'm trying not to take anything personally and just be explicitly about the work.

### How can I help you when you’re grumpy?

I like to talk through the issues and where I'm coming from them to try and understand what I'm missing or if I'm looking at the situation wrong, so engaging in a conversaton around that is helpful.  I'm not looking for blanket agreement, and helping me understand what I might not already get can be great.

## Feedback & Recognition

### How do you like feedback - the medium (chat, email, in person, etc.)

I'm open to most mediums, but sometimes verbal is easiest.  Don't let this prevent you from giving the feedback, do what works for you.  If I start digging in or explaining myself, I'm not trying to avoid the feedback, I'm trying to get a better understanding of the feedback and the situation.

### How do you like feedback - routine like in 1:1s, or as-it-happens

1:1s are a great time to do this, but don't let it stew until the next one if it is weighing on you.

### How do you prefer to receive recognition? (public or private)

In general I prefer private, but am not against public recognition.  Typically, I'm more concerned that I am actually valued and appreciated than whether or not I'm told such.

## Goals and Support
### What makes 1:1s the most valuable for you?

### What are your goals for this year? And for the next 3 months?

### What do you need from your manager?

### From your team? (this one is good if the 1:1 is with someone who manages people, but is typically relevant for IC’s, too)

### From your peers? (outside the team)

## The Wordy Question
### Human learning and growth requires the right amount of four things: new challenges, low ego, space to reflect and brainstorm, and timely and clear feedback. How are these four going for you? Is there one you need more or less of?

## The Most Important Question
### What’s your favorite way to treat yourself?

# Exploring me
